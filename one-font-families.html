        <p>This paragraph is nested inside an article. It contains many different, sometimes useful, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML5 tags</a>. Of course there are classics like <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and <small>small</small>        but there are many others as well. Hover the following text for abbreviation tag: <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>. Similarly, you can use acronym tag like this: <acronym title="For The Win">ftw</acronym>. You can define <del>deleted text</del>        which often gets replaced with <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
        <p>You can also use <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which sometimes is styled similarly to the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> or <samp>samp</samp> tags. Even more specifically, there is a tag just for <var>variables</var>. Not to be mistaken with blockquotes
          below, the quote tag lets you denote something as <q>quoted text</q>. Lastly don't forget the sub (H<sub>2</sub>O) and sup (E = MC<sup>2</sup>) tags. </p>

        <p>This is a mult-line blockquote with a cite reference. People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick
          carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’tdone as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
